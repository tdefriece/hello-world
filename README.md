# hello-world
hello is there anybody out there?

Just nod if you can hear me.  Can you tell me if it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding.  Distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.  Your lips move, but I cannot hear what you're saying.

Just a little pin prick -  Ahhh ahh ahh.
